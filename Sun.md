* Faculty Advisor: **Kazufumi Ito**
* Key findings: 
    * Solving sparse optimization problems. 
    
        When the matrix in a linear constrained problem is a sparse matrix, SVD decomposition is used. By extracting the submatrix that is greater than the tolerance value, the speed of solving using gradient descent is improved, and the numerical error of the solution is reduced.
        
    * SPG for solving Non-Smooth method.
      
        The objective of this study is to establish a bridge between the projection gradient method and the gradient descent method. This aims to extend the proof of convergence of the gradient descent method to the projection gradient method, and establish the RL condition for generalized gradients under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions.
        


**Research project:**

Improved Neural Network Optimization Algorithm,&emsp;June, 2022~October, 2022
* Key findings:
    * Improve the operation efficiency and accuracy of the Neural Network algorithm.
    
        The optimal training function and the optimal number of hidden layer nodes of the Neural Network are solved through experiments, the prediction accuracy of the Neural Network is optimized, and the scientificity of the algorithm is improved.
    * Establish the network as the core algorithm.
      
         The quantization adjustment rate is the weight coefficient, and the evaluation calculation of the improved impact factor MIV is realized.
    * Use gravitational algorithm to optimize the network.
      
        On the basis of MIV evaluation analysis, the gravitational algorithm can be used to optimize the Neural Network, and GSA can be introduced into the Neural Network algorithm, so that the optimal penalty coefficient and kernel function parameters can be automatically searched during the algorithm training process.
